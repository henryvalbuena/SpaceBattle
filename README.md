# SPACE BATTLE WEB BROWSER GAME

[DEMO](https://spacebattle-2040.herokuapp.com/)

### Description
- This was part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge
- It was developed using only plain JavaScript and DOM manipulation
- The rendering is pretty simple, no fancy OpenGL for now, using only canvas and time frames
- Lots of logic, functional programming and function objects.

### How to play?
- Move with your mouse
- Shoot hitting space
- Infinite level, kill as many as you can as you only have 3 lives and 1 continue.
- 2 weapon upgrades available, just pick the *PowerUps* when you see them
- If you get hit or struck by an enemy, you will gain an immunity shield for 3 seconds.

### PowerUps
